My grandfather was a wonderful man. A psychiatrist for nearly 60 years, a WWII veteran, avid car enthusiast and fisherman, father to 8 and grandfather to 28. I consider myself extremely lucky to have known him. 

My grandfather was a pensive man, always reading, thinking, exclaiming, and waxing poetic about the things he was passionate about -- which is just about everything. Over the course of his career, he would set aside times to write about his thoughts. He had too many thoughts constantly swirling to stick to one subject for long, so these speeches would occasionally turn into rambles. After he passed in early 2020, my family began organizing his belongings and sorting through the stacks of papers he had strewn across the library. While many of his writings were about discrete topics -- the war, growing up in Pittsburgh, the medical profession -- there are some whose topics weren't readily discernable to members of my family who had read them. There are 7 documents here: some of them are recollections of a single day, some are reminiscences on his childhood, and others are about his medical practice.

Naturally, I thought what better way to help everyone out than by doing some text analytics on them??
